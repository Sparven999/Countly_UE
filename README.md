# Countly_UE

Implementation of the Count.ly API/SDK for Unreal Engine. The project aims to implement the whole SDK development guide that can be found here with tweeks to fit the Unreal Engine. It will also incorporate full support for Blueprints. 

## Getting Started

Currently it will do nothing, feel free to join me though! 

If you want to join me, you will have to clone the repo and add it to a Unreal Engine project.
For more info about how to do that, look into Unreal Engines documentation. I will update this with time and as it gets more fleshed out. 

### Prerequisites

* Unreal Engine 4.24.3
* Countly Server (Setup and ready for test)

### Installing

Add it to your Unreal project and use it directly, or wait for build versions! 

### Coding style

This plugin will try to follow the coding standards set by Epic Games.
